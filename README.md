Early work on a portfolio website.

The writing style has a lot to change, I aimed to try and make a single page website with a sense of automation in which I could put in the data and it would automatically layout the page as desired. In the future it will be cleaned up massively.

It also displays some bugs on Firefox and due to DOM manipulation is currently somewhat slow.

 ## Todo
